    <!--5 MISSION-->
    <message name="LEARNING_5_TURN_1_TEXT"

    <message name="LEARNING_5_TURN_10_TEXT"
             value="Here comes a tricky part: you have to explode the mine without wasting a turn. Approach the mine, and as it starts beeping, get away!"/>

    <message name="LEARNING_5_TURN_12_TEXT"
